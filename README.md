# arTEXTEnglish
This project processes WordNet synsets to filter lemmas based on shared characters and syllable counts. It generates a list of "short words" (with fewer syllables) and their corresponding "long words" (with more syllables) and outputs the results to an Excel file.
# Requirements
Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+

Libraries:

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)

pandas (for handling dataframes and exporting Excel)

pyphen (for syllable counting)

The program uses the WordNet dictionary included with the nltk library.
# Installation 
1.-Clone the repository

2.-Install the required libraries

3.-Download the Wordnet Dictionary

4.- Excecute the script main.py
